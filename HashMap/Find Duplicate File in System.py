"""Description

Given a list of directory info including directory path, and all the files with contents in this directory, you need to find out all the groups of duplicate files in the file system in terms of their paths.
A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have exactly the same content.
A single directory info string in the input list has the following format:
"root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)"
It means there are n files (f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt with content f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content, respectively) in directory root/d1/d2/.../dm. Note that n >= 1 and m >= 0. If m = 0, it means the directory is just the root directory.
The output is a list of group of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format:
"directory_path/file_name.txt"
1.No order is required for the final output.
2.You may assume the directory name, file name and file content only has letters and digits, and the length of file content is in the range of [1,50].
3.The number of files given is in the range of [1,20000].
4.You may assume no files or directories share the same name in the same directory.
5.You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory. Directory path and file info are separated by a single blank space.

Example1
Input:
["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)", "root/c 3.txt(abcd)", "root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)", "root 4.txt(efgh)"]
Output:  
[["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt","root/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]

Example2
Input:
["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)"]
Output:  
[]

Follow ups:
1.Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?
It depends on the below factors: 
Goal: The goal of the search can impact the choice of algorithm. If the goal is to find all files in the file system, BFS may be a better choice. BFS explores the nodes in the file system layer by layer, starting from the root directory and moving outwards, so it can be more efficient when searching for files that are located in different parts of the file system. However, if the goal is to find a specific file or a subset of files that are located in a particular part of the file system, DFS may be more efficient.
File system structure: The structure of the file system can also influence the choice of algorithm. If the file system has a shallow directory tree with many files in each directory, BFS may be more efficient since it can reduce the number of files to search by exploring the directories first. If the file system has a deep directory tree with relatively few files in each directory, DFS may be more efficient since it can quickly narrow down the search to the relevant directories.
Performance: The performance of the algorithm can also be a factor. DFS may require less memory than BFS since it only needs to keep track of the current path and not the entire queue of nodes to explore. However, DFS may be slower if the target files are located deep in the directory tree or in a subtree, since it may need to explore many irrelevant directories before finding the target.

2.If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?
If the file content is very large (GB level), reading the entire file content into memory may not be feasible or efficient. In that case, we can modify the solution to use a hashing algorithm that processes the file content in chunks, and compares the hash values of the chunks to identify duplicate files.

3.If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?
Same as above, just change the chunk size to 1kb.

4.What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?
O(n * k). n is the number of files and k is the average size of each file. The most memory-consuming part of the solution is the dictionary file_dict, which stores the hash values and file paths for each file. The memory usage of the dictionary can be optimized by using a generator expression to read each file block by block, rather than reading the entire file into memory at once. This way, we only keep a small buffer of data in memory at a time.

5.How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?
In the modified solution that uses a hashing algorithm to identify duplicate files, there is a chance that files with different content may have the same hash value, resulting in false positives. However, the probability of such collisions is extremely low for a secure hash function like SHA256.
To further minimize the possibility of false positives, we can add a step to compare the file sizes of the files with the same fingerprint. If the file sizes are not equal, it is very unlikely that the files have the same content, even if they have the same hash value.
